# 📌 Machine Learning Project: Clustering & Classification

## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains my final project for the **Machine Learning Course** at Dicoding. The project involves both **supervised learning (classification)** and **unsupervised learning (clustering)** using Python.

## 📊 Project Overview

### 🏷️ Classification
- Applied **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree** to classify data.
- Evaluated models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Dataset used: `Dataset_klasifikasi.csv`

### 🔍 Clustering
- Used **K-Means** algorithm to group data into clusters.
- Applied the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Dataset used: `dataset_clustering.csv`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries Used:** 
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- **Platform:** Google Colab for model development and testing

## 📌 Notes
- This project is part of the **Dicoding Machine Learning course** submission.
- All experiments were conducted in **Google Colab**, and the results are reproducible using the provided notebooks.
